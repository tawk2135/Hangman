# Hangman
Hi everyone 
  So this is a project for school that i have to create a the game hangman where the player has the app randomly chooses a word from the textfile and displays it on the app.
  The player will have 6 tries to find the word or else he will loose he will get one point for each right letter. And 5 points if he get all the letters. 
  The app has to be created by using Java and JavaFX.
  
  Happy Coding to myself
